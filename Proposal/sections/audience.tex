\subsection{Who cares?}

We see two potential audiences for our work:

Netflix's current subscriber base exceeds (TODO number) million users (TODO citation); Hulu is at 28 million (TODO citation) and growing twice as fast as Netflix.    Each company has a clear need to maintain viewership by both offering compelling \& relevant content and leading it's customers to that content.

But it's the movie viewers themselves who will benefit the most from \textbf{Movie Mood}.  No more frustrating time spent scrolling through pages of irrelevant movies.   No more wasted evenings watching something highly rated but completely off the mark.
