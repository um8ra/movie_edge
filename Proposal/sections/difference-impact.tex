\subsection{Difference and impact}
If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?

We believe our approach will lead to a movie recommender engine with the following characteristics: 1) scalable to 20m ratings dataset on low computational resources; 2) highly accurate; 3) offer the unique ability for the user to drive the recommendation process by choosing features that will influence how recommendations are generated. 

To showcase the benefits of our engine, we will implement several traditional collaborative filtering approaches and show that our model outperforms them "out of the box". We will also demonstrate how users can interact with the model. Unfortunately, time and resource constraints will prevent us from conducting a user-satisfaction study.
