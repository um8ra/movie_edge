\subsection{Difference and impact}
If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?

MovieDelver will improve on the current state-of-the-art in user-guided movie recommendation, MovieExplorer, by allowing users to express their feedback in a  more natural and direct way than selecting movies similar to what they would like to watch. 

To showcase the benefits of our engine, we will implement several traditional collaborative filtering approaches and show that our model outperforms them "out of the box". We will also demonstrate how users can interact with the model. Unfortunately, time and resource constraints will prevent us from conducting a user-satisfaction study.
