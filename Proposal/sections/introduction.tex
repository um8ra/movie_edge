It's Friday night and you would like to watch a movie.  You turn on your SmartTV, open \href{http://www.netflix.com}{Netflix}, and as you scroll through the \textbf{Recommended for You} list your frustration grows.   \textit{How did this get on the list?  I'm not interested in that tonight.  I just saw that film and hated it!}
